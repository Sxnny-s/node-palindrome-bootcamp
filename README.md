# Palindrome Validator Web Application

## Goal

This project is a simple web application that validates if a string is a palindrome on the server side using Node.js. The application uses the built-in `fs` (File System) and `http` modules to handle HTTP requests and file operations.

## Features

- Accepts a string via an HTTP request.
- Validates if the string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward).
- Uses the `fs` module to log the requests to a file for persistence.
- Responds to the client with the result of the palindrome check.
